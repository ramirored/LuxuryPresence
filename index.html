                <h2 class="WYSHTitle">Why you should hire an agent who has <br> partnered with a luxury real estate <br> marketing company.</h2>
                <p class="WYSHP">One of the biggest perks of working with a real estate agent is their ability to
                    market your property to the right target audience. A professional agent with the right experience will
                    be able to identify who will be interested in your property and implement effective strategies to reach
                    them via their website, paid advertising, social media, and other means. When you work with an agent who
                    has partnered with Luxury Presence, you benefit from the many different types of marketing capabilities
                    the company offers. Here is how:

                <h2 class="IandTElementH">Paid Advertising on All Channels</h2>
                <p class="IandTElementP">
                    To reach your potential buyers, you have to know who they are, where they
                    spend their time online, and how they make their buying decisions. Agents who
                    use luxury real estate marketing services are able to identify your niche market, then
                    create paid ads on Facebook, Google, Instagram, and YouTube that reach those interested in
                    your property. These paid ad campaigns are highly customized and targeted, ensuring you are
                    not spending money marketing to those who are not in the market for a property such as yours.

                <h2 class="IandTElementH">Expert Content Production</h2>
                <p class="IandTElementP">
                    Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate agent has to promote your property.
                    Being able to create high-quality content such as video and copywriting is an essential tool
                    that elevates the agents who use luxury real estate marketing services above their competitors.
                    According to a recent survey, 85 percent of buyers and sellers want to work with an agent who uses
                    video—and for good reason. An agent who uses video is able to connect with potential buyers on a deeper
                    level and build trust and rapport. When they use video to market your property, they are showing viewers
                    what it would really be like to walk through and live in your home—something that is much more difficult
                    to do with a written description.
                    However, written descriptions—or copywriting—is also important. Your property needs
                    to be described in appealing and vibrant terms on the listing and on any additional
                    marketing that is created to sell it. Those agents who work with Luxury Presence get
                    access to experienced real estate copywriters who create blogs, website copy, and
                    content marketing pieces that make your property attractive to potential buyers.

                <h2 class="IandTElementH">Effective Search Engine Optimization</h2>
                <p class="IandTElementP">
                Recent research has shown that 44% of buyers found the home they purchased on the internet. Many of them simply
                googled the search terms that they wanted in a new home and started their search that way. For your home to show up 
                in these types of searches, your real estate agent needs to use the right terms in your online marketing. 
                The effective use of these terms is referred to as search engine optimization or SEO. The process of identifying
                and correctly using the right terms is a bit of a science—one that the SEO experts at Luxury Presence have mastered.
                When a potential buyer searches terms that match your home, your property will show up in the results and provide 
                opportunities for the buyer to learn more.

                <h2 class="IandTElementH">Social Media Marketing</h2>
                <p class="IandTElementP">
                    If your real estate agent is an influencer on social media, he or she has access to thousands of niche 
                    buyers who are ready to invest in property. To be an influencer, an agent either needs to dedicate a large 
                    chunk of their time to social media or they need to partner with luxury real estate marketing service 
                    providers who can put in the work for them. Wouldn’t you rather your agent spent his or her time marketing 
                    your property and let an expert handle their social media presence? At Luxury Presence, our dedicated success 
                    team utilizes an agent’s stories and feed posts to help them go viral and become an authority in their industry. 
                    Once they’ve harnessed the power of becoming an influencer, they can use their voice to advocate for your home 
                    and sell it more quickly than their competitors.
